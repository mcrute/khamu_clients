# Khamu Magma and Kulacart Golang API

This software is a completely unmaintained relic of the past published
here in case anyone else can find some use for it.

## Why though?

This was written about 3 years ago to support a customer that was using the
[Khamu Sapphire](https://www.khamu.com/point-of-sale/sapphire-point-of-sale-software)
point of sale system. They wanted to be able to toggle online ordering
on and off on a schedule as their needs required as well as to pull
metrics from the Magma system for reporting a count of milkshakes sold
at their restaurant.

All of this was built by reverse-engineering Khamu's web portal software
and building an API for it. Over the years it has been a cat and mouse
game of them changing things to try to prevent such automation. Each
time they have lost (mostly because they seem to lack a competent
engineering team).

The client that commissioned this has long since migrated from Khamu
software to another vendor; as should you if you're still using them.
